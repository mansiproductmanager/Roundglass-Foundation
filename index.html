                The Roundglass Foundation (RGF Global) is on a mission to develop, replicate, and scale a development model for the under-served and marginalized rural communities. Our unique approach focuses on **Wholistic Wellbeing** by enabling people to take control of their own destiny through co-owned and co-created thematic interventions in areas critical for a better future, primarily in Punjab, India.
